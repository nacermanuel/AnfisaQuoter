# KATALOGY: BE MORE EFFICIENT, LET YOUR CUSTOMERS SEE YOUR CATALOG AND CHOOSE THEIR PRODUCTS.

**--UNDER CONSTRUCTION--**

If you own a small-business, where most of the sales process is done through WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger or Instagram Messenger, Katalogy is the tool that will free yourself from a lot of manual job. You can upload your products and share the link of your catalog to your customers, they will be able choose what they want, see the total they have to pay, and share with you the final quote so you just need process and ship.

So far, what we have is the front-end / customer side of the product, where you can see the list of products, their details, select and remove what you want and see how much you will spend on the purchase.
